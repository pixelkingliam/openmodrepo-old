#### Features

The compiled binary (`server.exe`) can be ran

on Linux with `mono server.exe`

and on Windows by opening the `server.exe` file

---

*This requires Mono (Linux/MacOS/Windows) or .NET Framework 4.7.2 (Windows) to be installed*

*The compiled binary requires Newtonsoft.Json.dll present next to it*

## Compiling

This project is made with Mono (.NET Framework 4.7.2) and should be compiled with it

running `msbuild` will result in a executable (`server.exe`)
